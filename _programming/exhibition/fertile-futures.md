Featuring 12 new art pieces, this body of work travels deep into the dark soily subterrain from which all life grows and asks; What are the roots of our collective culture? What are the foundations from which our social infrastructure sprouts? Are they life sustaining? Are they conducive to our collective flourishing? We are invited to re-dream these spaces! We are invited to sow care back into our bedrock. We are invited to play, experiment, collaborate, and fail forward!

Event Activities:
- Art Print Sale Fundraiser
- Food & Drinks (to enjoy outside)
