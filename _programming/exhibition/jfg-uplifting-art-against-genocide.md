 Honoring Local Palestinian & MENA Creatives
category: exhibition
date: 2024-03-09

Artists in the exhibition: Ahmad Almahdi, Rama, Yasmeen Khayr, and Fade Kareem.

In this time of deep grief and desperation, we need to continue to support Palestinian and MENA art, music and culture in the face of genocide, as we continue to call for a ceasefire now!
