 A community art exhibit by Palestinian & MENA artists.<br>
 Featuring art by: Rama, Ahmad Almahdi, Fade Kareem & Yasmeen Khayr.
category: exhibition
date: 2024-02-10

In this exhibit, the artists ask: what is our responsibility to Palestinian life and liberation? Who is born into the responsibility and what does it mean to––sometimes unwillingly––bear the weight of such responsibility? What role does this responsibility to liberation and honoring history play in one’s artwork?

We invite our community to join us in asking these questions and reflect on how we are responsible to one another and how we tend to our responsibilities.
