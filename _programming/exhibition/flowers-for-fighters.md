>“Hearts starve as well as bodies; Yes it is bread we fight for, but we fight for roses too.”
>– Judy Collins, <em>Bread and Roses</em>

In Chicago, we have a powerful history of unionists, socialists, anarchists, and everyday workers uniting for workers’ rights, but it was strikingly Black women who connected the workers’ fight with the fight for racial justice. Many of these individuals still often go unrecognized and unhonored.

Through the illustrative work of artist & organizer Monica Trinidad and photographic work of Love & Struggle Photos (Sarah-Ji), we attempt to create new traditions of recognizing and honoring the daily labor of our current day organizers, particularly women and gender non-conforming organizers & activists of color, who are fighting for justice in Chicago at the intersections of race, gender, and class.
