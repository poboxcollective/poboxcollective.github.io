Rogers Park Seed Library Open Hours are every second Sunday 3-4:30 pm and every third Tuesdays from 6-7:30pm. This is the time to pick up new seeds (free!), gift your surplus, or just hang out and talk seeds!

<h4>Rogers Park Seed Library Workday & Skillshare  3/2/24</h4>
First off, our workday will be focused on getting the rest of our seed donations processed and into envelopes so that they are available to the public as we enter the growing season. Please join us for this casual hangout if you are able!

Our skillshare will be designed so that as people stop by throughout the day there is information and people available to answer questions. We will have a few tables set up and library member Ash from @bricktownseedlings will be hosting demos on how to make/use soil blocks as a way easily grow your starts. And yes, you can take soil blocks home!

How do you start your seedlings? What methods have works well for you? What else have you learned about gardening in the city? We know there is so much wisdom in our community. Stop by for a bit to share your skills and/or hang out with us while we process seeds.
