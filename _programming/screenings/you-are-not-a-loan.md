<h4>ABOUT THE FILM</h4>
Activists and academics discuss the crisis of higher education and the growing movement to cancel student debt and make college free for all | A short film by Astra Taylor, a founder of the Debt Collective.

<h4>ABOUT THE DEBT COLLECTIVE</h4>
The Debt Collective is building a mass movement to transform individual financial struggle (and the shame and isolation that comes with it) into collective power. Alone, our debts are a burden, but together they give us power over an exploitative system. Join us to build a world where college is publicly funded, healthcare is universal, and housing is guaranteed for all.

The Debt Collective is the nation’s first debtors' union, with the mission to abolish ALL debt—student loan, credit card, carceral––and to build a world where college is publicly funded, healthcare is universal, and housing is guaranteed for all.

Come learn more about the work of the Debt Collective, the strides being made toward the abolition of student loan debt, and how you can get involved.

Join the fight in breaking the chains of student loan debt--Cancel the Debt, Strengthen Democracy!
