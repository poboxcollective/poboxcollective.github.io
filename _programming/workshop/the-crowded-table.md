At the dinner table, every interaction and conversation leaves a mark, every guest leaves an impression. This is where bonds are formed, identities are shaped, family arguments are had, decisions are made, important news is shared, and everyday happenings are celebrated. More than our bodies are nourished at the table. We nurture familial well being and individual mental health.

These tablecloths will aim to capture the spirit of what the dinner table means to you. Feel free to bring a tablecloth of your choice to work with. We will be screen printing, embroidering and drawing.
