 The Queer Bachata Social at PO Box collective starts with a warmup and intro to the fundamentals of Dominican Bachata, including partner dancing without the gendered assumptions about leading and following.

Class is followed by a dance party to practice your moves from 8-10:30pm. Allies welcome if they honor the QTBIPOC-centered space.

Put your party $ towards a just cause with donations collected for the Community Care Collective of the 33rd Ward going toward breakfast and lunch cooked with love by new arrival families for the ~50 fellow asylum seekers staying at the 17th police station.

About your host: Ana is a queer Dominican community organizer out to host an inclusive social space that brings their community together through dancing while supporting just causes.

No partner or previous experience required.
