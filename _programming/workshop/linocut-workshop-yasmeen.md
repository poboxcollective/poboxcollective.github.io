Yasmeen will teach you the basics of linoleum block printing and are beginner-friendly. We will use block printing as a medium for visioning our collective liberation!

The workshops will be held from 2pm-5pm on Saturdays this summer: June 8th, July 13th, and August 10th. The workshops will focus on envisioning liberation and roles for activating liberation. Please join us for one, two, or all three!

We're excited to have you join us!
