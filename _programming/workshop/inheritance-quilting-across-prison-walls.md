 Inheritance is a collaboration with a group of women in Cook County Jail. In class, they have been writing, drawing and telling stories about the idea of inheritance â€“ what was passed down to them in their families and what they want to pass down to their children and grandchildren.

During this three hour quilting circle, we will gather together to sew and embroider their designs and writing, while discussing the impact of incarceration on millions of families across the country.

Inheritance Quilt is organized in collaboration with the Chicago Community Bond Fund and Love & Protect, and supported by funds from the Illinois Humanities Envisioning Justice program and the SAIC Nichols Tower Residency.
