 What do we learn about a place by listening to the sounds that comprise its sonic dimensions?

Led by multi-disciplinary artist Mark Alcazar Diaz, participants in this sound workshop will explore the soundscapes of the Rogers Park neighborhood through walks and sound exercises. As the participants traverse the area, they will record sound clips of various parts of the community and reflect on the human and nonhuman interactions that generate these sounds. The group will then create a collective sound work that will illuminate layers of crossings and friction between the indeterminate objects that make up Rogers Park.

The collaboratively created soundpiece will be part of a group exhibition held at PO Box Collective in Spring-Summer 2025.
