 As the genocidal violence committed by the Israeli government continues, the conveners of the Jewish Fast for Gaza invite you to join us.
category: workshop

We will eat together before our fast, make art together, and bear witness to the unconscionable number of lives lost by reading aloud some of the names of those killed since October 7, broadcasting the reading into the neighborhood. As of November 6, the Israeli government has killed over 10,000 people in Gaza and injured tens of thousands more. Without a ceasefire, those numbers will continue to grow rapidly.

At the Saturday event, we will also provide art supplies so that people can make signs, banners, and other agit-prop for upcoming actions demanding a ceasefire, and there will also be an opportunity to participate in a ceasefire stitching project.

Please join us and feel free to bring food!

Kids are welcome!
- 4:00 pm: potluck and art-making begins
- 4:30 pm: music and havdalah
- 5:00 - 6:30: reading names and making art

The Jewish Fast for Gaza will continue our weekly fast until there is a ceasefire, and will continue our fast monthly thereafter until there is an end to the blockade of Gaza.

As we fast, we continue to ask people to donate the money they would otherwise spend on food to direct aid organizations in Gaza, including the Middle East Childrenâ€™s Alliance (MECA) and UNICEF.

Portions of this event will be live streamed.
