Nonfiction Read-Aloud Book Group meets online on the 2nd and 4th Mondays of each month @ 7:30pm. 
We’ve been meeting since 2019. Meetings are fluid. Pop in when you can! We take turns reading aloud to each other and stop the reading frequently to discuss the text, ask questions, and repeat sentences. People need not read aloud in order to participate.

[Email us](mailto:poboxcollective@gmail.com) for the link.

We are currently reading “**Let This Radicalize You: Organizing and the Revolution of Reciprocal Care**,” by Kelly Hayes and Mariame Kaba.

What fuels and sustains activism and organizing when it feels like our worlds are collapsing? 
Let This Radicalize You is a practical and imaginative resource for activists and organizers building power in an era of destabilization and catastrophe. Longtime organizers and movement educators Mariame Kaba and Kelly Hayes examine some of the political lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the convergence of mass protest and mass formations of mutual aid, and consider what this confluence of power can teach us about a future that will require mass acts of care, rescue and defense, in the face of both state violence and environmental disaster.

The book is intended to aid and empower activists and organizers as they attempt to map their own journeys through the work of justice-making. It includes insights from a spectrum of experienced organizers, including Sharon Lungo, Carlos Saavedra, Ejeris Dixon, Barbara Ransby, and Ruth Wilson Gilmore about some of the difficult and joyous lessons they have learned in their work.
