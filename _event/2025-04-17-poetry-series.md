The PO Box Poetry Series was started in the spring of 2022. We aim to bring poets local to the neighborhood together with poets from across Chicago and beyond to form a stronger community through poetry. The readings are free & open to the public.

Please join us at the PO Box Collective on Thursday April 17th for an awesome writing workshop and reading in collaboration with Exhibit B! 

There will be an optional generative writing workshop prior to the reading led by Leah Dawson and Lemmy Ya'Akova from 6:30pm-7:30pm. Pizza Lobo has generously offered to donate a few pizzas for those needing a bite during the workshop.

We will then round out the night with readings at 8:00pm featuring Lemmy Ya'Akova, Nisha Atalie, and Sylvia Jones (whose new book, Television Fathers, is out with Chicago's local Meekling Press!).   

Come hangout with us for National Poetry Month!! We can't wait to see you there!
