The PO Box Poetry Series was started in the spring of 2022. We aim to bring poets local to the neighborhood together with poets from across Chicago and beyond to form a stronger community through poetry. The readings are free & open to the public.

Before the reading, we host a generative writing workshop and potluck, coordinated by Alex J. Cope, from 6:30pm - 7:30pm. The workshop is led by different visiting writers. All are welcome to join: this is a low-stakes time to write, eat, and meet artists in the community. The reading itself starts at 8:00pm.

This month the reading will be hosted by the Exhibit B Coordinators with the workshop being led by Leah Dawson and Lemmy Ya'Akova. Temperance Aghamohammadi will be the night's show coordinator.

Pizza generously donated by Pizza Lobo.
